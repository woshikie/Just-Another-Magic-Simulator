#Just Another Magic Simulator

Exactly as it sounds like, JAMS is an open source project to simulate Magic the Gathering.

The aim of this project is to have MTG able to be simulated on Mobile devices such as iOS and Android, thus Unity. 

Cards' details will be gathered from [DeckBrew's API](https://api.deckbrew.com/) dynamically.
